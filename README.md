## Site 1
1. http://beachslang.com/?fbclid=IwAR32sdpin8QHOxu_RvKlmYPGfbZee5ybJXww7DJtpnT97vakUplLaEvriV8
2. I got to this website through Facebook.
3. It is a current seeming website, but with a alternative flair.
4. It's fairly typical navigation. The menu is along the top and then once you bring your browser size down it goes into a basi hamburger menu. The home screen is different in how you can click on one of the two pictures and then find videos from that version of the band. It is very common so it is easy to use and to find things. 
5. The two pictures featured on the home page are interactive by bringing you to another part of the webpage which shows you different videos and music from the two versions of the band. 
6. I like this website. It is easy to navigate and it takes you exactly where you want to go. It contains a lot of links to other websites, which can get confusing. It is styled very nicely.
7. I would make the navigation menu larger, because it is somewhat small and blends into the one picture.

## Site 2
1. https://www.bustle.com/
2. I found this website on Facebook.
3. It looks very clean, classic, and timeless. It is a simple black and white design with a nice light sans-serif typeface. 
4. The navigation is common, with a hamburger menu opening into the options. The menu at the top is interactive by having the icons change colours as you go over them. 
5. There is a list of cards which you can scroll through with the most recent articles. Within each article are link which lead to other articles from that website or others, such as the New York Times.
6. I think this is a very beautiful website because of it's classic and clean design, it is also very easy to navigate anr very informative. 
7. I would make the site a little more interactive, perhaps with an action associated with moving over the cards or to have more moving aspects to the page.

## Site 3
1. http://www.johngreenbooks.com/
2. I got to this website from googling John Green.
3. This is a very well thought out website. It is designed in a very interesting way with the screen being split in half, with a photo and then information on the other side. The colours are only blue and yellow even for the pictures. This gives a unitfied feeling. 
4. The navigation is common but it does it in a slightly different way, which makes it easy to use and familliar but it still feels new. The main menu is in a hamburger menu but then once pulled out, it takes up half the screen. All of the options change colour as you go over them with helps you know which are links and what isn't.
5. The main page has links within the frist paragraph and as you roll over them they change colour. Under the movies tab there are all the movies that have come from his books which feature an area where you can watch the trailer. 
6. This website is kind of funky in it's design as it is a very bright colour palette and a very impactful design. Overall the experience is fun and it really refects the tones of his books. 
7. I would offset the spliting of the screen so it was off center a little bit, just to make it a bit more interesting to the eye, but overall it's a really good website.

## Site 4
1. https://www.glamour.com/?us_site=y
2. This is from a magazine I like to read.
3. It has a very sleek black and white design, with a large title and larger picture cards for their main articles. this gives it a classic clean look. 
4. There is a menu along the top with the different categories of articles, which is further broken down withing those categories. It is simple to navigate and fairly common in design. 
5. When you roll over the article the title changes colour, and often when you go to a new part of the website then a pop up will come up and can navigate you to another part of the page. 
6. I really like the clean and classic layout of the site it translates well across seasons and years. It is well designed and easy to navigate. 
7. I would make some more things interactive or more things moving and maybe bring out more seasonal aspects to the website so it stays current.

## Site 5
1. https://www.sharpie.com/
2. I found this site on google, but was inspired by the pens sitting on my desk.
3. It is set up with a very clean grid design. It has a banner running across the top, with 4 circles to break up the rigid square grid of the rest of page. With an alteraternating shaded sides of the picture going down the page. 
4. There is the typical menu across the top but then also other sub menus further down the page. 
5. You can click on the different kinds of markers which then takes you to pages about them and where to buy those markers. Each picture has a link to a article that relates to the pictures. 
6. It is super colourful and fun website, which I really like because it relates to the markers and how artistic it is. The designers did a very good job of showing the creativity of the markers. 
7. One thing I would want to change would be make the interactions show the creativity of the rest of the site. The site is very creative but it gets lost within the navigation system.
