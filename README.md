## Site 1
1. http://beachslang.com/?fbclid=IwAR32sdpin8QHOxu_RvKlmYPGfbZee5ybJXww7DJtpnT97vakUplLaEvriV8
2. I got to this website through Facebook.
3. It is a current seeming website, but with a alternative flair.
4. It's fairly typical navigation. The menu is along the top and then once you bring your browser size down it goes into a basi hamburger menu. The home screen is different in how you can click on one of the two pictures and then find videos from that version of the band. It is very common so it is easy to use and to find things. 
5. The two pictures featured on the home page are interactive by bringing you to another part of the webpage which shows you different videos and music from the two versions of the band. 
6. I like this website. It is easy to navigate and it takes you exactly where you want to go. It contains a lot of links to other websites, which can get confusing. It is styled very nicely.
7. I would make the navigation menu larger, because it is somewhat small and blends into the one picture.

## Site 2
1. https://www.bustle.com/
2. I found this website on Facebook.
3. It looks very clean, classic, and timeless. It is a simple black and white design with a nice light sans-serif typeface. 
4. The navigation is common, with a hamburger menu opening into the options. The menu at the top is interactive by having the icons change colours as you go over them. 
5. There is a list of cards which you can scroll through with the most recent articles. Within each article are link which lead to other articles from that website or others, such as the New York Times.
6. I think this is a very beautiful website because of it's classic and clean design, it is also very easy to navigate anr very informative. 
7. I would make the site a little more interactive, perhaps with an action associated with moving over the cards or to have more moving aspects to the page.
